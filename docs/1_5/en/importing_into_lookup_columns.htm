<h1>Importing into Lookup Columns</h1>
<p><span>You can
 import data to a lookup column in the destination table using the</span>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup Table Translation</span> <span>module.</span></p>
<p>In order to implement
    this translator, the source table must contain at least one column that
    refers to a unique value in a related table such as a gender that a person
    belongs to. During the translation process, the system will attempt to
    lookup this value and extract a corresponding value ideally, the value
    of the lookup column and use this value in the primary reference table,
    which is the lookup table.</p>
<p>Example:</b>
    Say we have a person CSV file that we would like to import to the person
    table in the STDM database; the source data such as a spreadsheet that
    contains a gender column that has the gender of each record as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Male</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Female</span>. However, if the destination
    table column uses a gender lookup table, the values in this lookup column
    is stored as integer, representing the id of the lookup value - Male or
    Female. Through, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup Table Translator</span>,
    we are able convert each value in the csv file that is a text with a value
    of Male or Female to an integer corresponding to the id of the lookup
    values - Male and Female.</p>
<p>The steps below
    clarifies how you can convert data stored as a text in a source table
    (csv, shp, etc) to an integer that corresponds to the id of the lookup
    value being converted from the &#160;source table.</p>
<p>1. Prepare the
    source table such as a csv with a lookup value written into it. In this
    case, a gender information is added with values Male and Female as shown
    in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/csv_table.png" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:321px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>&#160;2. You
    need to create a lookup table and add the values of Male and Female in
    the Configuration Wizard as discussed in <a href="creating_lookups.htm">Creating
        Lookups</a> topic. Make sure the values in the lookup table and in your
    source table (eg. csv file) have the same case and spelling. Otherwise,
    it will not import correctly.</p>
<p>3. Start the
    Import Data module located in the STDM toolbar as highlighted in the image
    below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/import_data.png" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:737px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>4. Choose the
    T<span style="font-weight: bold;">extual data</span> radio button and
    choose the <span style="font-weight: bold;">csv</span> file by clicking
    on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span> button as shown
    in the image below. You can also use a spatial data if needed.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/import_csv_select.png"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:587px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>5. Choose the
    table to which the data is going to be imported into and click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Next</span> button. In this case, it
    is the person table that is selected as highlighted in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/import_choose_table.png"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:582px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>6. Align the
    source and destination columns as shown in the image below so that they
    are in line and we can import data into the correct column. To align them
    you can use the up and down arrows or using a drag and drop. &#160;Then
    check all the columns you want to import data from. Make sure you have
    also selected the lookup column as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/import_align_columns.png"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:589px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>7. Click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Value Translators</span> <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Plus</span>
    button and click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup values</span>
    menu item as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/import_lookup_select.png"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:590px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>8. The <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Lookup Translator</span> popup window loads.
    Choose the lookup table in which the lookup values are translated. In
    this case we have used the gender lookup so we have to use the gender
    lookup named <span style="font-weight: bold;">check_gender</span> as shown
    in the image below.</p>
<p><img
         src="1_5/en/images/lookup_translator.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:489px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>9.
    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Default lookup value</span> drop
    down enables you to choose a lookup value to that will be used in case
    the source table has no value or invalid values. This might be relevant
    in some cases. Click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ok</span>
    button.</p>
<p>10.
    You can now access the main <span style="font-weight: bold;">Import</span>
    wizard. Here you can edit the existing value translator using the Edit
    button or remove it completely. When done, click on the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Finish</span>
    button to finish the importing. If successful, you will see a success
    message as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img
         src="1_5/en/images/import_finish.png" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:596px;"
        border="0"/></p>

    <title>Managing Social Tenure Relationship</title>


</head>

<body>


<p>‘People – land’
    relationships can be expressed in terms of persons, group of people and
    institution (parties) having a right to parcel, garden, or structure (spatial
    units). In STDM, this right is called Social Tenure Relationship (STR).
</p>
<p>The Social Tenure
    Relationship has its own table that stores each person's relationship
    to a spatial unit. Most importantly, it also gives you an option to choose
    the type of social tenure relationship between the person and the spatial
    unit. In addition, you can upload a supporting document that can be any
    document you think is useful for informational purpose and as evidence.
</p>
<p>The STR table
    has two modules that are used to create, edit, and search STR. </p>

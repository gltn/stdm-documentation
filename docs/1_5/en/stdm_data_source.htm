<h1>STDM Data Source</h1>
<p>An STDM report must contain a data source which contains data that will
    be used in the underlying document. Depending on the desired output of
    the report, the data source can simply be from an STDM table corresponding
    to an entity or a database view that represents a more complex relationship
    between different entities such as those participating in a social tenure
    relationship. In both cases, the data source must include a set of fields
    that will be used across the report. These data fields can then be used
    directly in some data-driven items (such as data labels or maps) or be
    linked to related fields in other data-driven items (such as attribute
    table, photo, graphs, etc.). When the report is processed, the data resulting
    from the queries run on the data source will be dynamically inserted and
    linked to the corresponding data-driven items based on the item configuration
    specified at design time.</p>
<p>If you wish to generate a map based document using the default Social
    Tenure Views, you need to use the Spatial Unit View. However, if you need
    to include information about the party in the map based document, you
    can link it through the <a href="adding_attribute_table.htm">Attribute
        Table item</a> instead of <a href="adding_a_data_label.htm">Data Label
        item</a>. However, if your configuration does not allow multiple party
    records to be linked to a spatial unit record, you can use Party Views
    as a data source. </p>
<p>This
    panel enables you to select a table that will be the source for data label,
    map, attribute table, photo, and chart. One data source should be used
    for the entire template. Once you choose a data source, every item you
    add should either use the data source as a source or provide a linking
    column to another table that provides the content to a template item.

<p>The
    panel is located in the right side of Document Designer as highlighted
    in the image below.</span></p>

<h1>Adding a Chart</h1>
<p>You can add charts whose data is derived from the STDM database. Currently,
    only vertical bar graphs are supported. More chart types will be added
    in the next major release.</p>
<p>The charts are best suited for an aggregate data. This requires the
    creation of more views linked to the default view that comes with STDM.
    The steps below will enable you understand how to create a basic view.
    The steps in creating an advanced chart are <span>as
 shown in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/map.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:486px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>When you release
    it, a box like the image below<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>will
    be<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>created. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/chart.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:349px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>5. Make sure you have selected the chart box as shown
    in the above image and open the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> STDM
 item properties</span> tab. You will see the following. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/chart_tables.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:767px;" border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">References</span> refers
    to any table that is used as a data source of the chart. You will find
    all tables and views of the current profile. Choose a table that you want
    the chart data to be based on. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data source</span> <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">field</span> refers to a data source column
    that is used to link the reference with the data source table. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referencing</span> refers
    to the references table column linking the data source, which has similarity
    with Data source field in its function here. </p>
<p>6. Choose Series Properties, which refers to the X axis
    field and the Y axis label in the chart.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/image166.gif" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:774px;" border="0"/></p>
<p style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; 
	 font-weight: normal;"><b style="font-weight: normal;"><span>The
 fields and labels in the above image refers to the following. &#160;</span></b></p>
<p>X
    Field</span> refers to the column to be used as a source of data for the
    X- axis. </p>
<p>X
    label</span> refers to the label of the X-axis. </p>
<p>Y
    label</span> refers to the label of the Y-axis. </p>
<p>Proceed to choose
    the Y-axis field in the next box explained in the next step. </p>
<p>7. Choose the
    value field (Y-axis value source column), legend name, and chart colour.
</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/y_field.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:790px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>Value
    field</span> refers to the Y-axis value <span>(see
 in the image above)</span>. The selected column in this case is <span
            style="font-style: italic;">ownership_type</span> but you can choose
    any other column you wish. </p>
<p>Fill
    colour</span> refers to the colour of the bar in the chart. Click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">blue box</span> and choose other colours
    if you would like to change it. </p>
<p>Legend
    name</span> refers to the title of the legend box. Normally, this refers
    to the Y-axis value/ the Value field. </p>
<p>8. Choose the
    graph properties by adding title of the chart, and by enabling and setting
    the position of the legend. See the image below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/image167.gif" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:526px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>If you do not
    check <span style="font-weight: bold;">Insert legend</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">checkbox</span>,
    the legend will not be shown in the generated document. </p>
<p>The default position
    of the legend is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic</span>, which
    means, it will be placed anywhere in the chart area where there is a space.
    This is recommended to avoid overlapping of the legend with the chart
    bars. You can also choose other positions by clicking on the drop down
    menu. </p>

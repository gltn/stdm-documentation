<p><span>Document
 Designer is an STDM module that enables you to design a template so that 
 you can generate documents based on STDM database automatically. </span>Document
    Designer is built on top of QGIS Print Composer. This enables Document
    Designer be able to use different features and tools of the Print Composer.
    <span>Using Document Designer, you can create templates
 that can be used for title deeds, certificates, letters, parcel maps, 
 statistical reports and so on. Once a document template is designed, you 
 can generate documents for one or more records using Document Generator 
 as explained in </span><a href="generating_documents_using_templates.htm">Generating
        Documents Using Templates</a><span> topic. </span></p>
<p>Note:
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">when designing a template, make sure
 you are creating it for the correct profile and entity. If you create 
 a template while logged into one profile and later try to generate a document 
 while logged into another STDM profile, the template file will not be 
 visible.</span></p>

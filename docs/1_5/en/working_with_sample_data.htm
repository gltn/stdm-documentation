<h1>Working with Sample Data</h1>
<p><span>The sample data is provided during
 the STDM installation. It is saved in </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">C:/Users/your-user/.stdm/SampleData</span><span
> folder. Replace </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">your-user</span><span
> with the currently logged in PC User. The sample data
 is used for examples in this documentation. </span></p>
<p><span>This sample data contains several
 forms of data;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Georeferenced map data (basemap/Raster
 data)</span></p>
<p><span>2. Persons data in *csv format (in
 excel sheets).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Shapefiles (Vector data)</span></p>
<p><span>4. GPX files (GPS points data)</span></p>
<p><span><span>To use the sample data, make

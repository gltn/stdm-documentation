<h1>Tips and Workarounds</h1>
<p>While using <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Document Designer</span>
    you might face issues that could prevent you from using Document Designer.
    These issues are because of the limited flexibility of QGIS Print Composer
    on which the Document Designer is based on. This limitation will be resolved
    in QGIS 3.0. </p>
<p>These issues can be resolved through tips and workarounds that are listed
    below. </p>
<p>1. Do not generate a document using a template that is open in Document
    Designer. This will block you from adding any more items into the template.
    To fix the issue, close and open the Document Designer and open the template.
</p>
<p>2. The attribute table formatting will be lost when re-opening a saved
    template. This is a QGIS <span style="font-weight: bold;">Print Composer</span>
    known issue. Thus, it is recommended to add the formatting of the attribute
    table before saving the template for the last time to avoid re-formatting
    it. </p>

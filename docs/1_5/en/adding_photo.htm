<h1>Adding Photo</h1>
<p><span>A
 photo</span> could be any image that is uploaded as a supporting document
    in the&#160;entity editor/ form and the new&#160;social tenure relationship
    wizard. This feature is very useful when you wish to attach documents
    or photos inside a generated document. </p>
<p>To add photo, follow the steps below. </p>
<p><span><span><span
>1. Select a
 data source by choosing a table or a view as shown below. </span></span></span></p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/data_source.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:480px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    Only the current profile tables and all views in STDM database load. </p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    When choosing a view, make sure you have chosen the view that is created
    using current profile tables. You can identify that by looking at the
    profile name at the beginning of view name. </p>
<p>2. Select a referenced
    table if you have chosen a view in the data sources as shown above (see
    the image below). &#160;A referenced table refers to a table that the
    template will be working for. In other words, the reference table forces
    the template to only work for a certain entity. &#160;This is useful when
    <a href="generating_documents_using_templates.htm">Generating a document</a>.
</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/ref_table.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:477px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 11pt;">For this demonstration, the Person table is used 
 as a referenced table but you can choose any other based on your needs. 
 </span></p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    The above two steps are mandatory for views and the first step is mandatory
    for table data sources.</p>
<p>3. Click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Photo</span> button located in STDM
    Document Designer toolbar (see the image below).</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/photo_button.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:351px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">4. Start creating
 a photo box by clicking on one point in the template page that will be 
 its top left corner of the photo. Then start dragging the cursor to the 
 bottom right direction to expand its size.</span></p>
<p>While dragging
    it, you can see a red box and a cursor that looks like the plus (+) sign
    <span>as
 shown in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/map.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:486px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>When you release
    it, a box like the one below<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>will
    be<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>created. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/photo_icon.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:234px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>5. Make sure you have selected the photo box as shown
    in the above image and open the STDM item properties tab as shown below.
</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/photo_tables.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:758px;" border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">References</span> refers
    to an entity supporting document table name that contains the reference
    of a supporting document uploaded to an entity. An entity supporting document
    table is created by STDM with the following format. </p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">profile_prefix_entity_name_supporting_document</span>.
</p>
<p>For instance, a Social Tenure Relationship supporting
    document looks like </p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">lo_social_tenure_relationship_supporting_document</span>.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">lo</span> refers to the
    profile prefix of Local Government profile. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Data source</span> field
    refers to a data source column that is also included in the entity supporting
    document table. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Referencing</span> refers
    to the entity supporting column linking the data source, which has similarity
    with Data source field in its function here.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Document type</span>
    refers to the supporting document type that you have specified in the
    Configuration Wizard. The default document type is General. If you add
    more document types for a given entity, you find them listed in the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Document type</span> drop down menu. </p>
<p>Make your selection similar to the one shown in the image below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/photo_refer.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:494px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>For instance, the above selections will enable you to
    properly add documents used for social tenure relationship. If you want
    to use a supporting document of another entity, look for your entity name
    in place of <span style="font-weight: bold;">social_tenure_relationship</span>.

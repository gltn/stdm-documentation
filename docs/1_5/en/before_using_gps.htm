<h1>Before using GPS</h1>
<p><span>Global Positioning System (GPS) refers
 to a satellite-based navigation system constituting a constellation of 
 24 satellites and their ground stations.</span></p>
<p><span>The use of GPS circles around precise
 positioning of objects and people including scientific studies for the 
 purpose of obtaining useful information relative to their geographic locations.</span></p>
<p><span>When using GPS, the GPS device needs
 to communicate with the satellite at real time to give the positions.</span></p>
<p><span>This is why it is advisable to use
 GPS device in the open field to avoid obstruction from buildings and trees, 
 which hinder visibility of satellites and ultimately reduces the accuracy 
 of the final data.</span></p>
<h2>What to know when using GPS in the field</h2>
<p><span>While using GPS in the field it is
 important to take note of the following.</span></p>
<p><span>What affects the accuracy of the data?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: outside; margin-left: 24px; 
		 text-indent: 0px;">
    <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >Objects such as buildings, mountains, tall trees, etc.
	 have a reflection effect to the transmitted signal which may cause 
	 delay to the received signal thereby introducing errors.</span></p></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >These objects also have</span><span>
	 an obstruction effect, which blocks the signals and reduces the number 
	 of available satellites.</span></p></li>
    <li style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >The amount of humidity or density of the clouds in the
	 atmosphere also affects the signal strength. It can slow down the 
	 signal as it passes through them, which affects the overall accuracy 
	 of the obtained position.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with Garmin GPS data</h2>
<p><span>Refer to Garmin website</span> <a
        href="http://www.garmin.com">www.garmin.com</a> <span
>&#160;</span><span>for detailed description
 on how to capture data using Garmini GPS.</span></p>
<p><span>Having collected field data using
 the GPS, office work remains important to put the collected data to usable 
 format.</span></p>
<p><span>Garmin by defaults stores its data
 in World Geodetic System (WGS 84).</span></p>
<p><span>This becomes easy to use as it can
 be </span><span>overlaid</span><span>
 to Google maps and other global maps or images.</span></p>

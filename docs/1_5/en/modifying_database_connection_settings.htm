<h1>Modifying Database Connection Settings</h1>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> module enables you
    to modify your current STDM database connection settings. This setting
    change requires logging out of STDM for the change to be applied.</p>
<p>You can change the database server host, port and database connected.
</p>
<p>To change the database connection, follow the steps below. </p>
<p>1. You can type the values in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Database 
 Properties</span> box as shown below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/options_db_connection.JPG" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:627px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>a. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Host</span><span
> refers to</span><span> the location of
 a computer that has hosted the database server (PostgreSQL). If the database 
 server is installed in your own computer, you have to enter </span><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">localhost </span><span>as
 shown above. However, when PostereSQL that holds the database is installed 
 in an office network, the IP address is different from localhost. It could 
 be a number like 192.168.0.23 or any other number with such a format as 
 specified by the system administrator. This is relevant when STDM is installed 
 for governmental or non-governmental organizations with a centralized 
 database server. </span></p>
<p><span>b.</span> <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Port</span>
    <span>refers to an endpoint of communication for the database
 server (postgreSQL). To access the database from STDM, we need to know 
 its port. The most common port values for PostgreSQL are </span><span
    >5432, 5433, or any other port as specified during installation.</span></p>
<p><span>c.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Database</span>
    <span>refers to a data storage location in which the entire
 data of STDM is stored. By default, during installation, it is set as 
 </span><span>stdm</span><span>. You can enter
 any other database that you want to connect to after installation using 
 PostgreSQL administration software called pgAdmin III. If you want to 
 use your own database, make sure the PostGIS extension is installed and 
 added to the database that STDM uses. Otherwise, STDM cannot run. </span></p>
<p>2. If you have already saved a database connection in QGIS's DB Manager,
    you can extract it by checking on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Extract
 from existing connection</span> option. </p>
<p>The drop down next to the checkbox gets enabled and if you have a saved
    connection. Click on the drop down menu and select one item (see the image
    below).</p>

        border="0"/></p>
<p>3. You can also test the connection setting that you have added by clicking
    on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test connection...</span> button
    as highlighted below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/options_db_connection_test_con.JPG" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:502px;" border="0"/> &#160;</p>
<p>When you click on Test connection... button, a popup appears where you
    have to enter your database username and password (see the image below).</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/connection_test1.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:332px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>Next, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test</span> button
    to check if the database properties you have filled are valid. If the
    connection is successful, a success message is shown (see the image below).
</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/connection_test.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:363px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>A successful connection means that you can change your database connection
    with no errors. </p>
<p>Once you have modified the connection setting, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apply</span>
    button (<img  src="1_5/en/images/apply.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:103px;"
                 border="0"/>).
</p>
<p>Logout of STDM for the changes in the database connection to be applied.
    &#160;</p>
<p>If you are connecting to a new database or a database that does not
    have the latest configuration, run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration
 Wizard</span> to create STDM database. Failure to do this will mean no
    access to most modules of STDM. In this case, when you try to access STDM
    modules you will see an error message similar to the one shown in the
    image below. </p>

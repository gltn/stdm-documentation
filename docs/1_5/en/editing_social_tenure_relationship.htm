<h1 style="margin-right: 0px;">Editing Social Tenure Relationship</h1>
<p>Editing a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tenure Relationship</span> enables
    you to modify a social tenure relationship of a party as well as a spatial
    unit. This option will enable you to modify the party/ person, the spatial
    unit, the tenure type, the tenure share, the supporting documents uploaded
    for the social tenure relationship and the tenure validity period. Adding
    multiple records is not possible while editing because each social tenure
    relationship corresponds to one party. Replacing party and spatial unit,
    however, is possible. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">It is similar to the </span><span
        style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-weight: bold;">New Social
 Tenure Relationship</span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;"> 
 module. The edit module opens with all social tenure relationship information 
 loaded into it so that you can modify it.</span></p>
<p>To edit a social tenure relationship record, follow the steps below.
</p>
<p>1. To start <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Editing Social Tenure Relationship</span>
    module, we need to first make a query using View Social Tenure Relationship
    as explained in <a href="querying_viewing_social_tenure_relationship.htm">Querying/
        Viewing Social Tenure Relationship topic</a>. Alternatively, we can get
    the feature details of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial Unit</span>
    using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial Entity Detail</span>
    module discussed in <a href="viewing_a_spatial_entity_details.htm">Viewing
        a Spatial Entity Details</a> topic. </p>
<p>2. A record that
    has a social tenure relationship displays a result similar to the image
    below. Click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tenure Relationship</span>
    row to enable the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> button
    that is located above the search result. &#160;</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/image56.gif" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:402px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>Alternatively,
    right-click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tenure Relationship</span>
    row to open the context menu as shown in the image below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/image59.gif" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:314px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>You can also edit
    a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Tenure Relationship</span> record
    from the Spatial Entity Details by clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social
 Tenure Relationship</span> item and clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span>
    button as shown in the image below. </p>
<p><img
         src="1_5/en/images/STR_feature_details_edit.png" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:406px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>3. When you click
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit</span> button or menu (<img  src="1_5/en/images/edit.png"
                                                                          alt=""
                                                                          style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:16px;"
                                                                          border="0"/>), you will
    be able to see the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Social Tenure
 relationship</span> module as shown below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/STR_edit.png" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:622px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>Editing a Social Tenure relationship is similar to <a
        href="Creating_Social_Tenure_Relationship.htm">creating
    a Social Tenure Relationship</a>. The major difference is that you can
    only have one party/ person as each social tenure relationship corresponds
    to one person. It is the same for spatial unit. </p>
<p>As a result, when you try to add another party on top of the existing
    one, the existing record will be replaced by the newly selected one. The
    same applies in the spatial unit page.</p>

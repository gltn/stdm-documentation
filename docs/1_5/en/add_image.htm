<h1>Add Image</h1>
<p>You can add any
    external image such as logos, backgrounds, etc into the template. </p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 11pt;">Follow the steps below to add images. </span></p>
<p>1. Click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Image</span> button located in Composer
    Item toolbar (see the image below).</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/image.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:45px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>2. Start creating
    an image box by clicking on one point that will be its top left corner.
    Then start dragging the cursor to the bottom right direction to expand
    its size.</p>
<p>While dragging
    it, you can see a red box and a cursor that looks like the plus (+) sign
    <span>as
 illustrated in the image below.</span> &#160;</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/map.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:486px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>When you release
    it, a box like the image below<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>will
    be<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>created. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/imagebox.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:472px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>You can always
    resize the image box by pressing its corners and moving your cursor.</p>
<p>3. There are two
    options of adding image. You can add an image by browsing a file by clicking
    on the indicated button on step 1 or by expanding Search Directories menu
    and selecting one of the images provided by QGIS.</p>
<p>You can set the
    resize mode of the image in case the image is bigger than the image box.
</p>
<p>You can change
    the placement of the image inside the image box as shown in step 3 of
    the image. Middle is recommended. </p>
<p>If you are using
    icons provided by QGIS, you can change their body and outline colour,
    and the outline width. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/images_prop.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1083px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>You
    can scroll down in item properties and change the image orientation and
    position.</p>

<h1>Manual Upgrade</h1>
<p>If the automatic
    upgrade failed, you can still make the upgrade from the Options Module
    to upgrade from STDM 1.0 or 1.1 to STDM 1.4. After upgrading to STDM 1.4,
    the configuration will be automatically updated to STDM 1.5. &#160;</p>
<p>1. Open the Options
    module by looking for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span>
    under Admin Settings menu located in STDM Toolbar or STDM menu. </p>
<p>Click on<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Options </span>menu<span>&#160;</span><span
>Please
 ensure that you do not interrupt the upgrade process</span> involves your
    data. To reduce the risk of interruption, the progress bar cannot be closed
    by clicking on the close button; this also prevents QGIS from being closed.</p>
<p>Once the process
    is complete, the progress bar disappears and you can start to use STDM.
    &#160;</p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    Once you make a successful upgrade, you will no longer be able to upgrade
    an old configuration. </p>

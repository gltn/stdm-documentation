<h1>Automatic Upgrade</h1>
<p>The automatic upgrade happens when you login to STDM for the first time
    after upgrading to STDM 1.5. </p>
<p>To upgrade automatically, follow the steps below. </p>
<p>1. You will be asked to agree on the terms and conditions of STDM. This
    might not be shown if you are migrating from STDM 1.4. </p>
<p>In case you have uninstalled QGIS with its registry using third party
    uninstallers, STDM might lose all the directory settings. </p>
<p>In such a case, you will see the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Directory 
 Settings</span> dialog requiring you to select the supporting document,
    template and output folders. At the top, <span>the
 <b>Directory Settings</b></span> dialog explains for what purpose STDM
    uses those directories to help you remember the folders. Click on the
    folder browse button (<img  src="1_5/en/images/open_file.png" alt=""
                               style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:24px;" border="0"/>) to
    select the required folders
    (see the image below). </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/document_path.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:511px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Closing the Directory
    Settings dialog without selecting and applying the settings will lead
    to the cancellation of the migration process. This will lead to the temporary
    loss of access to the existing profile, data, and templates. </p>
<p>If you do not see the dialog, it means, your directory setting is not
    removed from your system.</p>
<p>The upgrading of the configuration takes place. <span
        style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">&#160;</span></p>
<p>You will see a progress dialog
    that looks like the following image.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/upgrade.JPG" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:390px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>&#160;<span>Ensure</span><span
>&#160;</span><span>you
 do not interrupt the upgrade process</span> as the process involves your
    data. To reduce the risk of interruption, the progress bar cannot be closed
    by clicking on the close button; this also prevents QGIS from being closed.</p>
<p>Once the process
    is complete, you will see a popup requesting you to view changes and new
    features of STDM (see the image below). </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/license.PNG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:447px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>It is recommended to view it. Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span>
    button to view the changes and new features or click on the <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">No</span>
    button if you do not wish to see the changes. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/upgrade_success.jpg"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:391px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span>You will now</span> be able to see your
    profile with the default profiles of STDM. </p>
<p>You can explore
    these profiles and on the way learn the capabilities of STDM 1.5 configuration.
    If you don't need them, you can delete them as discussed in <a href="deleting_profiles.htm">Deleting
        Profiles topic</a>. </p>
<p>You can also customize
    the profiles by changing their entities, columns, etc using Copy Profile
    and Save as Draft features in the Configuration Wizard. </p>
<p>In case of a failed upgrade, you can upgrade using the <a href="manual_upgrade.htm">Manual
    Upgrade</a> option. </p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    Once you make a successful upgrade, you will no longer be able to revert
    back to an old configuration. The Upgrade button will be disabled. </p>

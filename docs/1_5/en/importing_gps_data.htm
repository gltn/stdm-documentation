<h1>Importing GPS Data</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Feature Import</span> tool is a
    special functionality within STDM that allows uploading, editing of GPS
    field recorded features and saving into STDM <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial
 Entity</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Feature Import</span> tool provides
    the following functionalists.</p>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Upload of <span style="font-weight: bold;">.gpx</span>
                files.</p></li>
            <li><p>Selection of feature type for the uploaded file.</p></li>
            <li><p>Editing and visualization of a feature.</p></li>
            <li><p>Creation and saving of feature attribute data.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>The steps below describe the process of importing GPS recorded features
    into STDM <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial Entity</span>.</p>
<p>1. Add a spatial entity layer into the map canvas using the steps under
    <a href="adding_a_spatial_entity_layer.htm">Adding a Spatial Entity Layer</a>
    topic.</p>
<p>2. Once the layer is added select the layer in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Layers</span>
    panel as shown below. Click on it to select the layer.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/layerspanel.png" alt="" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:275px"/></p>
<p>3. On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial Unit Manager</span>,
    click on the button <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Import Feature</span>
    as highlighted in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_button.png" alt="" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:293px"/></p>
<p>4. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Feature Import</span> dialog
    appears as shown in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_feature_import.png" alt="" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:517px"/>
</p>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Feature Import</span> module
    loads with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feature Import</span> tab
    and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Entity Editor</span> that enables
    you to add a record as discussed in <a href="adding_a_record.htm">Adding
        a Record</a> topic.</p>
<p>5. Select the GPX file. When you click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Browse</span>
    button as highlighted below, a window will pop up to allow you to choose
    a <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPX</span> file from your computer.
    <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 14.6667px; font-variant-ligatures: normal;
		 font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; widows: 2; 
		 -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline	 ! important ; 
		 float: none;">You can also drag</span><span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><span
            class="bold_text" style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 14.6667px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; 
	 orphans: 2; text-align: left; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;">.gpx</span><span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&#160;</span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
														 font-size: 14.6667px; 
														 font-variant-ligatures: normal; 
														 font-variant-caps: normal; 
														 orphans: 2; text-align: left; 
														 widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; 
														 display: inline	 ! important ; 
														 float: none;">&#160;file 
 into the file path text box.</span> Once you select a file with an extension
    of <span style="font-weight: bold;">.gpx</span>, it will be added in the
    file text box.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_feature_import_browse_btn.PNG" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:514px"/></p>
<p>6. Once the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Feature Type</span> is
    enabled, click on the drop-down button to select a <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPX
 Feature type</span> that relates to the added <span style="font-weight: bold;">.gpx</span>
    file as demonstrated in the previous step.</p>
<p>Currently the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS Feature Import</span>
    tool supports the following GPX formats;</p>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Waypoint</span>: An
                individual point among a collection of points with no sequential
                relationship.</p></li>
            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Track</span>: Ordered
                list of waypoints describing a path or a line.</p></li>
            <li><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Route</span>: Ordered
                list of waypoints representing a series of significant turn
                or stage points leading to a destination.</p></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>When you select a feature type, the following takes place.</p>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The GPX Data Editor box is populated with a table containing
                points that are in the .gpx file. You can select, and unselect
                points using the checkbox in the first column of the table.</p></li>
            <li><p>A Preview feature is rendered in QGIS <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map
			 Canvas</span> as illustrated in the image below. The Preview
                feature shape changes based on the removal and selection of
                points. Highlighted points are differentiated with QGIS default
                selection colour, in this case yellow (see the image below).</p></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_feature_import_description.PNG" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:1158px"/></p>
<p>The table enables you to choose points you would like to import. This
    is achieved by clicking on the checkbox shown on the first column of the
    table if it is not checked.</p>
<p>Remove points that are not needed or points that are wrongly recorded
    by removing the selection. To remove the selection, click on the checkboxes
    on first column.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A removed point</span>, from which
    the checkbox selection is removed, is also removed from the feature on
    map. This results in the change in the shape of the feature.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">An included point</span>, with a checkbox
    checked, can be seen with a green round marker on the map, as shown in
    the figure above. This means that the points with a green round colour
    will be included in the feature created from the GPS points.</p>
<p>To check all checkboxes, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Select 
 All</span> button as shown in the image below. This will redraw the feature
    in the map canvas showing all the data points. All data points would be
    imported into STDM if this option is chosen.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_select_all_2.PNG" alt="" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:534px"/>
</p>
<p>Click on<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Clear All</span> button (highlighted
    in the image below) to uncheck all points in the GPX Data Editor and to
    clear the feature from the map canvas. Doing this prevents you from importing
    GPX data into STDM as no points would have been checked for import.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_clear_all.PNG" alt="" border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:525px"/></p>
<p>You can also change the values of the coordinates if needed. Double
    click on a coordinate (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Longitude</span>
    or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Latitude</span> field) to change its
    value as shown in the image below. Complete the edit by hitting <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">Enter</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">Return</span>
    keys on the keyboard. This has the effect of redrawing the feature on
    the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Map Canvas</span>.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_edit_point.PNG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:801px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>If you want to sort the order of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Points</span>,
    you can use the drag and drop feature. To sort the points, select a Point
    you would like to move. While clicking on the selected row/ <span style="font-weight: bold;">Point</span>,
    move your cursor to make the row float. You can now move it with your
    cursor and drop it in a row you want it to be moved as shown in the image
    below. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_point_drag.jpg" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:536px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>7. Once you finish choosing the points, click on the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 Primary</span> tab to add attribute information as shown in the image
    below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_feature_import_from.PNG" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:523px"/></p>
<p>Fill out the form with relevant information uploaded supporting documents
    if needed. You can also upload supporting documents. Using the Collection
    tab, you can link the record to a related entity if the entity is referenced
    by another entity. For more in working with Entity Editor, review &#160;<a
            href="Adding_a_Record.htm">Adding a Record</a> topic.</p>
<p>Once done, click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span>
    button to add the feature into the spatial entity with its attribute data
    added using the form. </p>
<p>A success message, as shown in the image below, pops up. </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/gps_success.PNG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:336px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>Click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> button on the
    message box. This will take you back to the Feature Import tab where you
    can edit, check or uncheck previously uploaded GPX data points. You can
    as well at this point select different<span style="font-weight: bold;">
 Feature Type</span> or upload a new GPX file altogether. You can also
    click on the Cancel button of the GPS Feature Import dialog to close the
    window, when you finish importing <span style="font-weight: bold;">GPS
 Features</span>. You can check the result by viewing the added feature
    in the map canvas and its attribute data in the entity browser.</p>
<p>If the feature is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Line</span>, a
    line will be drawn when the user selects the corresponding vertexes comprising
    the line feature.</p>
<p>Similarly, for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Point</span> feature,
    only one point is selectable to import to STDM database.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: If you wish to learn about
    the feature but lack a .gpx file, you can use the STDM Sample data <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">gpx</span> files. The sample data is located
    in .<span style="font-weight: bold;">stdm</span> folder under your user
    folder inside <span style="font-weight: bold;">SampleData/Sample_GPX_Data</span>
    folder.</p>

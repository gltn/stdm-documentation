<h1>Getting Started with the Configuration Wizard</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 11pt;">Creation and management of profiles is done through 
 the profile configuration wizard. The wizard has several pages that allow 
 you to configure and manage your data profiles.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To access the
    wizard, click the Configuration Wizard icon on the STDM plugin toolbar
    as shown below.</p>

        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:882px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span>As seen in the image below, each</span>
    configuration process on the wizard is represented by a single page with
    an interface that is divided into three sections. These sections are:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
    <li><p>Upper
        section - Step/page description</p></li>
    <li><p>Middle
        section - Profile setup section</p></li>
    <li><p>Bottom
        section - Navigation section</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/wizard_sections.png"
        alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:1017px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 11pt;">&#160;To access a step on the wizard, use the buttons 
 on the navigation bar.</span></p>
<h2>Navigation buttons</h2>
<p>Back
    button</span> - Allows you to navigate backward through the wizard steps.
    The button takes you one step backward from your current step. This button
    remains disabled, if you are in the first page of wizard.</p>
<p>Next
    button</span> - Allows you to navigate forward through the wizard steps.
    The button takes you one step forward from your current step. This button
    remains disabled, if you are in the last page of the wizard.</p>
<p>Cancel
    button</span> - Used to terminate the configuration process and exit the
    wizard dialog.</p>
<p>Finish
    button</span> - This button will appear when you get to the final step
    of the wizard. The button allows you to save your profile configuration
    settings into the database.</p>
<p>Close
    button</span> - Allows you to close and exit the wizard.</p>
<p>Help
    button</span> - Used to access the help manual.</p>
<h2>Creating and Saving of settings</h2>
<p>Every time you
    open the configuration wizard, it will read and load previously saved
    configuration settings from a file called <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">configuration.stc</span>.
    The configuration wizard will now be in an <span style="font-style: italic;">edit
 mode.</span> In this mode you can create, edit or delete items - profiles,
    entities, columns or lookups.</p>
<p style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; 
	 font-weight: normal; color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
    It is important to know, during edit mode any changes (create, edit or
    delete) you do on the wizard will NOT be saved in the database or in the
    configuration file until the Finish button is clicked at the last step
    of the configuration wizard.</p>
<p>In total STDM
    wizard has five steps, each step represents a different configuration
    section for the profile. The following section of the document will show
    details of each step.</p>

<p>As already discussed, STDM is a QGIS plugin that enables
    you to utilize all the great features of the most popular open-source
    geo-spatial software, QGIS. Consequently, you can use any QGIS features
    &#160;and also benefit from QGIS features that are customized for STDM.
    The customized QGIS features make it very easy to manage spatial data
    in STDM. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spatial Entities</span>
    can be created just like any other entity. <span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">A
 spatial entity is an entity with at least one geometry column as defined 
 in the </span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-weight: bold;">Configuration 
 Wizard</span><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;">. </span>A spatial
    entity should have at least one geometry column and an attribute data,
    that holds non-spatial data. </p>
<p>STDM supports point, line, polygon, multipoint, and multiline
    and multipolygon geometry. </p>
<p>In STDM, at least one spatial entity is required to be
    used as a spatial unit. A spatial unit is a spatial entity that participates
    in social tenure relationship. A spatial unit holds data of a parcel,
    structure, farmland, etc. You can also create other spatial entity holding
    different spatial data.</p>
<p>The following sub-sections enable you manage spatial data.

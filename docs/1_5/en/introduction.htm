<h2>Social Tenure Domain Model</h2>
<p>The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) is a pro-poor, gender responsive
    and participatory land information system developed by the Global Land
    Tool Network (GLTN). It is one of twenty-six land tools being developed,
    tested and applied by GLTN partners to promote secure land and property
    rights for all.</p>
<p>STDM, as it stands, has the capacity to broaden the scope of land administration
    by providing a land information management framework that would integrate
    formal, informal and customary land systems and administrative and spatial
    components. STDM makes this possible by incorporating tools that facilitate
    recording of all forms of land rights, all types of rights holders and
    all kinds of land and property objects/spatial units regardless of the
    level of formality.</p>
<h2>Core Values</h2>
<p>STDM's core values and principles are pro-poor, good governance, equity,
    subsidiarity, sustainability, affordability, systematic large scale, and
    gender responsiveness.</p>
<h2>The STDM Universe</h2>
<p>STDM is a pro-poor, participatory and affordable <a
        href="http://gltn.net/index.php/land-tools/introduction-to-land-tools">land
    tool</a> that broadens the scope of land administration by incorporating
    all person/s to land relationships beyond formal/legal land rights, cognizant
    of the continuum of land rights. STDM has four inter-related components.
    These are:</p>

    <li value="1" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >A new way of thinking about land records</span></p></li>
    <li value="2" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >A free and open-source software package to record information
	 about land</span></p></li>
    <li value="3" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >An approach of collecting data about land</span></p></li>
    <li value="4" style="margin-left: 0px; text-indent: 0px;"><p><span
    >A way of using and disseminating information about land</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The STDM Universe consists of an extensible data model, conceptual and
    operational model, database implementation, software modules and an extensible
    architecture.</p>

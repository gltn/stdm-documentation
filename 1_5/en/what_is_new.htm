</head>

<body>




<h1>What's New in STDM Version 1.5?</h1>
<p>STDM 1.5 is a
    full release which includes enhanced functionality and stability improvements.
    The changes include the ability to save configuration as draft; copying
    an existing data profile; additional customization options pertaining
    to social tenure relationship; simpler importation of lookup values; direct
    switching of data profiles; identity tool for accessing the main information
    pertaining to a spatial unit (such as tenure status and related parties)
    and user interface enhancements in the GPS import tool.</p>
<p>The following
    sections summarize the new features in STDM 1.5.</p>
<h2 id="h.gfczgxfbla6o">Database Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="h.iid5aae2sh9m">Copy Data Profile from Existing One</h3>
<p>This time saving
    Database Configuration feature allows you to make a copy of an existing
    profile as shown in the image below. If you identify a profile in your
    configuration that you would like to use as a template, now you can replicate
    it, rename it, edit and use it without designing a new configuration from
    scratch. This feature greatly saves on time and increases productivity.</p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image15.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:774px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.csxlowbtztpj">Save Configuration as Draft</h3>
<p>This feature provides
    the ability to save the current customization as a draft as shown in the
    image below. If one is configuring a complex profile that might take hours
    or days to finish, it is now possible to progressively save the customization
    as a draft until completion. The draft copy will be loaded automatically
    next time the Database Configuration Wizard is loaded.</p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image22.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:501px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.o24yv2cpk1vh">Enhanced Input Validation</h3>
<p>The text input boxes for defining
    the profile name, entity name, column name, lookup name, and lookup Value
    name attempt to automatically update the entered text such as space and
    uppercase letters. The validation shows an error message when typing invalid
    characters as shown in the image below. </p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image12.png"
        alt="column_validation.PNG" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:395px"/></p>
<p>Users can also
    copy paste characters with space and capital letters in the text boxes.</p>
<h3 id="h.uo85tgpv5ma3">Percent Column Type</h3>
<p>This is a decimal
    data type with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 100. The image below shows
    the Percent column in Column data type drop down menu<span class="c4">.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image20.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:368px"/></p>
<p>The
    input widget in the entity editor corresponds to a spin box with a ‘%’
    suffix appended to the value &#160;as shown in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image00.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:321px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.ab8t1apkl0fr">Auto Generated Code Column Type</h3>
<p>This column type can be used to
    create unique codes such as parcel number, house number, etc. The column
    type can be found in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Column data
 type</span> drop down menu as shown below. <img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image16.png"
                                                 alt="auto_generated_code.PNG" border="0"
                                                 style="width:100%; max-width:392px"/></p>
<p>One can set the column properties
    such as the source table of the code prefix, code separator and leading
    zero as shown in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Column Property</span>
    below<span class="c4">.</span></p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/auto_generate.PNG" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:377px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>The column type
    generates unique codes automatically based on the selected prefix source
    as shown in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image03.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:285px"/></p>
<h3>Decimal Number Column Type</h3>
<p>The decimal column type is enhanced
    with the ability to change the number of decimal places and the precision
    as highlighted in the image below.</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/decimal_places_precision.png" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:333px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<h3 id="h.snpjp7tl6p4s">Multi-Party Entity Types in Social Tenure Relationship</h3>
<p>A profile’s social tenure relationship
    can now incorporate one or more party entity types; this is applicable
    in contexts where the tenure relationship of spatial units is shared by
    different party entity types such as person or community entities.<span
            class="c4">&#160;See the red-colored box labelled ‘a’ in the image
 below.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.5bs0zaamd780">Date Validity Ranges in Social Tenure Relationship</h3>
<p>The respective ranges for start
    and end dates can optionally be specified when configuring a profile’s
    social tenure relationship. This ensures that the date ranges for new
    social tenure relationships are validated within these set limits.<span
            class="c4">&#160;See the red-colored box labelled ‘b’ in the image
 below.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.c9q5n9hdzogm">Visual Representation of Social Tenure Relationship</h3>
<p>The basic data model of a profile’s
    social tenure relationship can now be visualized in the configuration
    wizard &#160;as shown in the image below. The model can be annotated with
    user-defined text and exported as an image file. This is useful in helping
    to visualize the linkage between the social tenure relationship entities
    as well as using the image files in reports, presentations etc. <span
            class="c4">See the red-colored box labelled ‘c’ in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image13.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:1016px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.u048um4lsc9">Social Tenure Relationship Views</h3>
<p>An additional
    Social Tenure Relationship database view is now created upon configuring
    a new data profile. This view uses the spatial unit id as its id column.
    This makes it easy to design and generate documents for profiles that
    may have a party linked to more than one spatial unit. Consequently, two
    default database views are created:</span><span class="c4">&#160;</span></p>
<ul class="c32 lst-kix_lfo6n6mhdm75-0 start">
    <li class="c1 c24"><p><span class="c20">Spatial Unit View</span>&#160;contains
        <span class="c20">Spatial Unit</span>&#160;records linked to <span
                class="c20">Party </span>records through the <span class="c20">Social
	 Tenure Relationship</span>. The view and layer name is denoted by
        [<span class="c26 c9 c20">spatial_unit_table_name]_vw_social_tenure_relationship</span></p>
    </li>
    <li class="c1 c24"><p><span class="c20">Party Views</span>&#160;(one
        or more) contain <span class="c20">Party </span>records linked to<span
                class="c20">&#160;Spatial Unit</span>&#160;records and social tenure
        information. The view is denoted by [<span class="c9 c20 c26">party_table_name]_vw_social_tenure_relationship</span>
    </p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h.415u56zg63rs">Current Profile Selection</h2>
<p>The process of
    setting the current data profile has been significantly simplified with
    the addition of a profile selection combobox in the STDM toolbar as shown
    in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image01.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:778px"/></p>
<h2 id="h.qh9gi1ae4wv4">Social Tenure Relationship</h2>
<h3 id="h.5k9cdm3nc956">Social Tenure Relationship (STR) Editor</h3>
<p>The Social Tenure Relationship
    Editor<span class="c4">&#160;has been completely revamped by utilizing
 a tree structure and a single page design that makes creating an STR record 
 very quick and easy thereby reducing time in repetitive STR creation workflows.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.a8j3c0u2y2kv">Local Spatial Unit Preview</h3>
<p>A local map preview
    has been added on the existing web preview of spatial units as shown in
    the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image14.png"
        alt="STR_sp_unit_local_preview.png" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:963px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.92u6b9xnb8hy">Multiple Party Entity</h3>
<p>Users can choose more than one
    party entity to be linked to a spatial unit as shown in the image below.
    The party entities must be selected in the Configuration Wizard<span class="c4">.</span></p>
<p>&#160;<img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image07.png" alt=""
              border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:955px"/>
</p>
<h3 id="h.zhyc1cwb9onk">Tenure Share</h3>
<p>&#160;option
    has been added in the Tenure Information section. This feature enables
    the user to specify the tenure share for the spatial unit as a percentage.
    The module automatically updates the other party records’ tenure share
    when the share of one party record is manually changed by the user.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image23.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:970px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.prg9kc3fwg0i">Tenure Validity Period</h3>
<p>Users can specify the tenure validity
    period by choosing the start and end dates of the tenure agreement as
    illustrated in the image below. The tenure duration&#160;box enables the
    user to specify the date ranges by entering number of year or months,
    this is used to automatically compute the end validity date. </p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image19.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:972px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.jkmvtie3nr6t">Multiple STR Entry</h3>
<p>Users can add
    multiple social tenure relationship records without re-opening the editor
    as illustrated in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image05.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:958px"/></p>
<h2 id="h.yuc2syiogv3s">View Social Tenure Relationship</h2>
<p>Searching of
    STR records is possible using tenure validity period as shown in the image
    below. The filter can also be disabled using the checkbox in the Validity
    Period tab.</p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image04.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:997px"/></p>
<h2>Entity Editor </h2>
<p>A <strong>Subform</strong> inside the <strong>Primary</strong> form
    of STDM is added to enable you enter records on a different entity that
    depends on the <strong>Primary Entity</strong>. It also enables the user
    to edit and delete records from within the <strong>Subform</strong>. For
    instance, within a <strong>Household Entity</strong>, you can add a record
    of <strong>Household Income Entity</strong> as shown in the image below.
</p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/household_subform.PNG" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:677px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<h2>Data Import</h2>
<h3 id="h.6koeox46w6hp">Importing Lookup Values</h3>
<p>A lookup value
    translator has been incorporated to enable easier importation of lookup
    values &#160;as shown in the image below. Previously, one would need to
    use the related table translator. Using this new option, the only requirement
    is to specify the matching lookup table in the STDM database and configuration.
    A user can also specify a default value (from the selected lookup table)
    which will be used in case the value from the source table is not found.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image17.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:411px"/></p>
<h2 id="h.4oa3qyesf5ra">Spatial Unit Manager</h2>
<h3 id="h.apf1nscr8p1">GPS Feature Import Tool</h3>
<p>The GPS Feature Import&#160;has
    been completely redesigned into a single window where GPX file source
    and coordinate points selection is in one tab and attribute-related tabs
    such as Primary, Supporting Documents, and Collections tab are in <span
            class="c4">separate tabs as shown in the image below.</span></p>
<p>In addition, the tool enables users
    to rearrange point positions using drag-and-drop. To make it clear to
    the user on the impact of the changes, the selection and removal of a
    point automatically updates the preview map. Moreover, when selecting
    a row, a user can view which point they have selected as it is also highlighted
    in the preview layer. A user can also edit the values of each coordinate
    pair by double-clicking the Longitude and Latitude fields.</p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image09.png" alt="gps_import.PNG"
        border="0" style="width:100%; max-width:615px"/></p>
<h2 id="h.vo6dl6bp8wwg">Spatial Entity Details</h2>
<p>The Spatial Entity Details&#160;is
    a new module that provides a hierarchical view of<span class="c20">&#160;</span>Spatial
    Entities and Views by selecting one or more features in the map canvas
    as shown in the image below. If the vector layer is a Spatial Unit, it
    also displays the social tenure relationship information similar to the
    View Social Tenure Relationship module. Editing, deleting and the viewing
    of supporting documents is possible for relevant entities<span class="c4">.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image18.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:957px"/></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2 id="h.9bgqh1qrsgx1">Spatial Entity Browser</h2>
<h3 id="h.eswciasw1wsm">Multi-Selection of Records and Features</h3>
<p>The Spatial Entity Browser can
    now select multiple features in the map canvas whe<span class="c4">n multiple
 records are selected in the Entity Browser table as shown below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image02.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:984px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.nw0x49qf95oj">Ability to Control Map While Browsing Records</h3>
<p>The Spatial Entity
    Browser does not block the clicking of other STDM and QGIS user interface
    elements. This change enables the user to add a layer, pan the in the
    map canvas, etc.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.y7o82tqumw5m">View Social Tenure Relationship of the Selected
    Record</h3>
<p>Users can see
    the social tenure relationship details (via the Spatial Entity Details)
    of a selected record in the Spatial Entity Browser as shown in the image
    below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image11.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:875px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.yhe3v633swst">Documents Designer</h3>
<p>The attribute table composer item
    used by the Documents Designer has been updated to the latest version
    of QGIS attribute <span class="c12">table item</span><span class="c4">.
 This upgrade has enabled Item properties panel of the STDM attribute table 
 to add useful option under the Appearance options such as adding empty 
 rows, hiding/showing header, wrapping text, and other customization options 
 as shown below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image08.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:500px"/></p>
<h3 id="h.pwq0ztpccpx6">Options</h3>
<p>A check box to enable or disable
    debug mode has been added in the Options mod<span class="c4">ule as highlighted
 in the image below.</span></p>
<p><img title=""  src="1_5/en/images/image21.png" alt="" border="0"
        style="width:100%; max-width:650px"/></p>
<h2 id="h.md2cyzhg5wfk">General</h2>
<h3 id="h.7gji1xmdjfji"><span class="c7">Software Packages</span></h3>
<p>The all-in-one
    installer for STDM 1.5 is built upon the following packages: PostgreSQL
    v9.5, PostGIS 2.2 and QGIS 2.18. STDM is also compatible with QGIS 2.14
    and 2.16. See the links below for the full list of feature updates.</span></p>
<p><a class="c3"
      href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog216/index.html">QGIS
    2.16</a></span></p>
<p><a class="c3"
      href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog218/index.html">QGIS
    2.18</a></span></p>
<h3 id="h.pxvpmhe7r8gn">Enabling PostGIS Extension</h3>
<p>When users create the STDM database
    manually, there is no need of also creating the PostGIS extension as far
    as the PostGIS <span class="c4">extension is installed for the current
 PostgreSQL version. This is because, STDM enables the PostGIS extension 
 automatically, if it is not enabled for the database. This will greatly 
 reduce the error that happens due to missing PostGIS extension in the 
 STDM database.</span></p>

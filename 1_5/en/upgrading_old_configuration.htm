<h1>Upgrading Old Configuration</h1>
<p>If you miss the
    upgrading of STDM configuration from STDM 1.0 or 1.1 to STDM 1.4, you
    can still make the upgrade from the Options Module. The migration process
    is discussed in greater detail in <a href="migration_from_previous_version.htm">Migration
        from Previous Version</a> topic. &#160;</p>
<p>1. In the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> module, go to the bottom
    of the module and locate <span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade STDM
 Configuration to 1.4 </span>with the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 
 Upgrade </span>button as highlighted below. </p>
<p><img
         src="1_5/en/images/options_upgrade493448160.jpg" alt=""
        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:644px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>2. Click on the
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade</span> button. </p>
<p>In case you have uninstalled QGIS with its registry using third party
    uninstallers, STDM might lose all the directory settings. </p>
<p>In such a case, you will see a dialog requiring you to select the supporting
    document, template and output folders. Click on the<span style="font-weight: bold;">
 folder browse</span> button (<img  src="1_5/en/images/open_file.png" alt=""
                                   style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:24px;" border="0"/>)
    to select all the required
    folders (see the image below). </p>
<p><img  src="1_5/en/images/document_path.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:511px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Closing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Directory 
 Settings</span> dialog without selecting and applying the settings will
    lead to the cancellation of the migration process. This will lead to the
    temporary loss of access to the existing profile, data, and templates.
</p>
<p>If you did not see the dialog, it means your directory setting is not
    removed from your system.</p>
<p>This leads to
    the starting of the upgrade process. You will see a progress dialog as
    shown below. &#160;</p>
<p><img
         src="1_5/en/images/upgrade.JPG" alt="" style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:390px;"
        border="0"/></p>
<p>&#160;It
    is not recommended to interrupt the upgrade process as the process involves
    your data. To reduce the risk of interruption, the progress bar cannot
    be closed by clicking on the close button. This also prevents QGIS from
    being closed.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif;
	 font-size: 11pt;">Once the process is complete, you will be able to 
 use STDM with the updated configuration, database and templates.</span></p>
<p><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
    Once you make a successful upgrade, you will no longer be able to upgrade
    an old configuration. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Upgrade</span>
    button will be disabled. </p>

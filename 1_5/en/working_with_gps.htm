<h1>Working with GPS</h1>
<p><span>It is advisable to use GPS device in the open field
 to avoid obstruction from buildings and trees, which hinder visibility 
 of satellites when collecting data. Working with GPS in an obstructive 
 environment reduces the accuracy of the final data. Depending on the GPS 
 device, a GPS receiver must be locked to signals from at least 3- 4 satellites 
 to be able to calculate the position. The higher the signal strength in 
 terms of satellite signals, the higher the accuracy/reliability.</span></p>

    <title>Adding Items into a Template</title>


</head>

<body>




<p>The Document Designer
    enables you to add almost anything you may need in your template. You
    can add items that use STDM database as a source and your own custom inputs
    such as logos, photos, text, title, backgrounds, etc. that might make
    the generated certificate attractive and complete. </p>
<p>The diagram below
    explains the relationship of the STDM data source and the template items
    that are data driven and static. </p>
<p><img

        style=" border:none; width:100%; max-width:422px;" border="0"/></p>
<p>Before starting
    to design, it is good to carry out the following. </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">

    <li><p>Create
        a template design on paper or on Microsoft Word Document.
        &#160;This will help you know what you need to add in the
        template. </p></li>
    <li><p>Identify
        the data source to be used. To know the data source, you can
        view your record through Entity Browser. </p></li>
    <li><p>Have
        a record already added into the database to test your template.</p></li>
    <li><p>Identify
        your profile social tenure relationship view. </p></li>

</ul>
